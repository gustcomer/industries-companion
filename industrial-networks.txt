Glossary

Distributed Control System (DCS): control and monitor processes across various parts of a plant or facility, distributing the control functions among multiple controllers that are geographically dispersed.
  - it is composed of Controllers, I/O Modules, Communication Network, HMI, Engineering Workstations.
Fieldbus Protocols: a family of industrial computer network protocols used for real-time distributed control, primarily in automation systems.It is designed to link field devices like sensors, actuators, and controllers within an industrial network.
  - in a Fieldbus system, multiple devices are connected to a single communication bus, which reduces the amount of wiring needed and improves communication efficiency.
  - some Fieldbus protocols: PROFIBUS, FOUNDATION Fieldbus, CANopen, Modbus, DeviceNet, AS-Interface (AS-i), EtherCAT, HART, Interbus, PROFINET, SERCOS, ControlNet, FF-HSE.
Human-Machine Interface (HMI): dashboard that connects an operator to the machinery, equipment, or control system in an industrial environment.
IEC 61158: defines the fieldbus network protocols used in industrial automation.
  - unique in that it doesn't define a single fieldbus protocol but rather a collection of different protocols, each suitable for different applications.
  - released in 2000
  - covers several major fieldbus protocols like Profibus, Foundation Fieldbus, Modbus, EtherNet/IP, CANopen, HART, DeviceNet, Interbus, EtherCAT, ControlNet, PROFINET, etc.
Industrial Network: specialized communication network consisting of physical interconections used to connect various devices, sensors, controllers, and other equipment within an industrial setting.
  - the physical interconnection is constructed with electrical characteristics defined by a Standard, and communicates using a Protocol.
Protocol: defines the specific rules and methods of communication between devices within the context of a network, which may or may not adhere to an established standard.
Standard: in this context involves the types of physical connections and its electrical characteristics.
