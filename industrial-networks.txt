OT systems interface directly with machinery and equipment, such as PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, and DCS (Distributed Control Systems).

Glossary

Assets
  Physical Assets: assets such as sensors and actuators, servers, workstations, network devices, and PLCs.
  Logical Assets: assets such as flow graphics, program logic, databases, firmware, and firewall rules.
Communication Model: architectural strategies that help manage and structure the way different components of a backend system communicate with each other.
  eg: Request-Response, Synchrononus vs Asynchronous, Push, Polling, Long Polling, Server Sent Events, Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub), Master-Slave.
Critical Infrastructure: collection of physical or logical systems and assets, the failure or destruction of which will severely impact security, safety, the economy, or public health.
Distributed Control System (DCS): control and monitor processes across various parts of a plant or facility, distributing the control functions among multiple controllers that are geographically dispersed.
  - it is composed of Controllers, I/O Modules, Communication Network, HMI, Engineering Workstations.
DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol 3): set of communication protocols widely used in process automation systems, particularly within the electric and water utility sectors.
  - allows reliable data exchange between various components such as SCADA, RTUs and IEDs.
Fieldbus Protocols: a family of industrial computer network protocols used for real-time distributed control, primarily in automation systems.It is designed to link field devices like sensors, actuators, and controllers within an industrial network.
  - in a Fieldbus system, multiple devices are connected to a single communication bus, which reduces the amount of wiring needed and improves communication efficiency.
  - some Fieldbus protocols: PROFIBUS, FOUNDATION Fieldbus, CANopen, Modbus, DeviceNet, AS-Interface (AS-i), EtherCAT, HART, Interbus, PROFINET, SERCOS, ControlNet, FF-HSE.
Human-Machine Interface (HMI): dashboard that connects an operator to the machinery, equipment, or control system in an industrial environment.
IEC 61158: defines the fieldbus network protocols used in industrial automation.
  - unique in that it doesn't define a single fieldbus protocol but rather a collection of different protocols, each suitable for different applications.
  - released in 2000
  - covers several major fieldbus protocols like Profibus, Foundation Fieldbus, Modbus, EtherNet/IP, CANopen, HART, DeviceNet, Interbus, EtherCAT, ControlNet, PROFINET, etc.
IED (Intelligent Electronic Devices)
IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things)
Industrial Network: specialized communication network consisting of physical interconections used to connect various devices, sensors, controllers, and other equipment within an industrial setting.
  - the physical interconnection is constructed with electrical characteristics defined by a Standard, and communicates using a Protocol.
Industrial Protocols:
  Proprietary: S7, CDA, SRTP, etc
  Non-Proprietary: Modbus, OPC, DNP3, CIP, etc.
Master-Slave: communication architecture where a central device (master) controls and communicates with multiple subordinate devices (slaves).
  widely used in protocols for deterministic communication, ensuring real-time data exchange and control in automation systems.
  - the master initiates all communication and the slaves only respond when addressed by the master.
Modbus: communication protocol designed for industrial automation systems.
  Variants:
    Modbus RTU (Remote Terminal Unit): runs over serial communication (RS-232 or RS-485).
    Modbus ASCII: Also for serial but uses ASCII encoding, Human-readable but less efficient than RTU.
    Modbus TCP/IP: Encapsulates Modbus frames in TCP/IP packets, devices act as clients (masters) or servers (slaves), broadening compatibility.
OPC (Open Platform Communications): standard for data exchange in industrial automation systems.
  - it facilitates the seamless sharing of information between devices, systems, and software from different manufacturers.
  - Developed in 1996 by the OPC Foundation, originally based on Microsoftâ€™s OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) and COM (Component Object Model) technologies
OT (Operational Technology): hardware and software systems used to monitor and control physical processes, devices, and infrastructure in industrial environments.
  while IT focuses on data, computing, and communication systems (e.g., email servers, databases, and enterprise software), OT focuses on physical systems and processes (e.g., controlling a factory assembly line or monitoring an oil pipeline).
  OT consists of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) that include Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), Remote Terminal Units (RTU), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLC), Distributed Control System (DCS), etc.
Protocol: defines the specific rules and methods of communication between devices within the context of a network, which may or may not adhere to an established standard.
Request-Response: synchronous patterns that involves a client making a request to a server, which then processes the request and sends back a response.
  Client: entity that initiates the request.
  Server: entity that receives the request, processes it and returns a response to the client.
  Request: message sent from the client to the server that typically includes information like the desired operation, parameters and headers.
  Response: message sent back from the server to the client that usually contains the result of the operation requested, status information, and any necessary data.
Standard: in this context involves the types of physical connections and its electrical characteristics.
