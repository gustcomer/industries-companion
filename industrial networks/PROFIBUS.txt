PROFIBUS: (Process Field Bus) a standard for fieldbus communication in automation technology.
PROFIBUS DP (Decentralized Periphery): most widely used PROFIBUS variant designed for high-speed communication between controllers and field devices. Typically used in factory automation, where it connects PLCs to distributed I/O systems.
  - At 9.6 kbps to 93.75 kbps: Up to 1,200 meters; At 187.5 kbps: Up to 1,000 meters; At 500 kbps: Up to 400 meters; At 1.5 Mbps: Up to 200 meters; At 12 Mbps: Up to 100 meters.
PROFIBUS PA (Process Automation): PROFIBUS variant specifically designed for use in process automation, particularly in hazardous environments because supports intrinsic safety, making it suitable for use in explosive environments.
  - Up to 1,900 meters with up to 32 devices. If repeaters are used, the total length can be extended up to 10 kilometers.
