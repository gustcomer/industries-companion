Terms

HMI (Human-Machine Interface): provide real-time graphical representations of industrial processes, such as machinery operation, pipeline flow, or power system status.
  Operators can send commands to control equipment, adjust setpoints, or activate/deactivate certain processes.
IEC 60870
MES (Manufacturing Execution System): software used in manufacturing to manage, monitor, and control production processes in real-time.
  - serves as a bridge between ERPs and the actual shop floor operations.
  - ensures compliance with strict regulatory requirements and traceability.
RTU (Remote Terminal Unit): electronic device used to interface with sensors, actuators, and other field devices in remote locations, enabling the SCADA system to monitor and control industrial processes over a wide area.
  - while PLCs and RTUs share some similarities, they are typically used for different purposes.
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): commonly used for visualization, monitoring, and controlling industrial processes.

Standards

IEC 61131-3: standard for programming languages for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It defines five programming languages.
  Structured Text (ST): High-level, block-structured language similar to Pascal.
  Instruction List (IL): Low-level, assembly-like language (deprecated in recent updates).
  Ladder Diagram (LD): Graphical representation based on relay logic.
  Function Block Diagram (FBD): Uses blocks to represent functions and their data flow.
  Sequential Function Chart (SFC): Used for structuring and organizing complex control algorithms.
ISA/IEC 62443: framework for securing Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) addressing cybersecurity lifecycle of these systems.
