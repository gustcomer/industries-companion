Terms

DNP3
HMI (Human-Machine Interface): provide real-time graphical representations of industrial processes, such as machinery operation, pipeline flow, or power system status.
  Operators can send commands to control equipment, adjust setpoints, or activate/deactivate certain processes.
IEC 60870
RTU (Remote Terminal Unit): electronic device used to interface with sensors, actuators, and other field devices in remote locations, enabling the SCADA system to monitor and control industrial processes over a wide area.
  - while PLCs and RTUs share some similarities, they are typically used for different purposes.
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition): commonly used for visualization, monitoring, and controlling industrial processes.
