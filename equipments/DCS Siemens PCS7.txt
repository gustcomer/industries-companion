Glossary

COM: Component Object Model. language-independent, object-oriented system that allows different software components to communicate, serving as the foundation for OLE 2.0 and later technologies.
DCS: Distributed Control System. automated control system that Unlike centralized control systems, distributes control functions across multiple controllers, which are located throughout the plant or industrial environment.
Engineering Stations (ES): used for configuring, programming, and maintaining the PCS 7 system.
Maintenance Station (MS): workstation designed to monitor, diagnose, and maintain the health of the process control system and its associated components.
OLE: framework that allows applications to create and share objects or content with each other.
OPC: the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industry.
  - now the acronym stand for Open Platform Communications but the acronym OPC originally stood for OLE for Process Control. OLE meaning Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding.
  - its purpose was to abstract PLC specific protocols (such as Modbus, Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing HMI/SCADA systems to interface with a “middle-man” who would convert generic-OPC read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.
Operator Stations (OS): workstations where operators monitor and control the process.
SIMATIC: Siemens Automation Technology for Industry.
SIMATIC PCS 7: process control system that integrates various components of the SIMATIC family to provide a comprehensive solution for automating large-scale industrial processes.
Terminal Bus: a network within the PCS7 architecture that connects operator stations, engineering stations, and other human-machine interface (HMI) devices with each other and with the central control system.
  - typically operates using standard Ethernet-based network protocols like TCP/IP or Profinet.
