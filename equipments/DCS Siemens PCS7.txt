Glossary

COM: Component Object Model. language-independent, object-oriented system that allows different software components to communicate, serving as the foundation for OLE 2.0 and later technologies.
DCS: Distributed Control System. automated control system that Unlike centralized control systems, distributes control functions across multiple controllers, which are located throughout the plant or industrial environment.
Engineering Stations (ES): used for configuring, programming, and maintaining the PCS 7 system.
field bus: digital, two-way communication network that connects controllers (such as PLCs), sensors, actuators, and other field devices.
  - it represents the general type of network, Profibus PA (Process Automation) and Foundation Fieldbus (FF) are more specific examples of field bus networks.
HMI: human-machine interfaces.
Interlocks: control mechanisms designed to ensure that certain conditions are met before a process or machine can operate.
Maintenance Station (MS): workstation designed to monitor, diagnose, and maintain the health of the process control system and its associated components.
Modules: Power, Input/Output (I/O), Communications, Special Functions.
OLE: framework that allows applications to create and share objects or content with each other.
OPC: the interoperability standard for the secure and reliable exchange of data in the industry.
  - now the acronym stand for Open Platform Communications but the acronym OPC originally stood for OLE for Process Control. OLE meaning Microsoft's Object Linking and Embedding.
  - its purpose was to abstract PLC specific protocols (such as Modbus, Profibus, etc.) into a standardized interface allowing HMI/SCADA systems to interface with a “middle-man” who would convert generic-OPC read/write requests into device-specific requests and vice-versa.
Operator Stations (OS): workstations where operators monitor and control the process.
S7-4xxFH: PLC, but in the context of a SIMATIC PCS 7 system it can be referred as Automation System.
  - the xx denotes SIMATIC S7-400 series of PLCs.
  - F stands for "Fail-safe" which means they are capable of executing safety-related programs, or safety functions.
    - among the safety functions of the CLP: integrate both standard and safety-related control in a single system, special fail-safe I/O modules that are capable of handling safety signals, TÜV Certification.
  - H stands for "High Availability" controllers are designed for redundancy, meaning they have backup systems that automatically take over in the event of a failure in the primary system.
    - the redundancy in the CLP is possible due to 2 central processing units running in parallel (one CPU is the primary while the other is the backup or secondary), redundant power supplies, redundant communication paths, redundant I/O modules
  - if the label redundant is written after the PLC it indicates that there is a backup system to ensure continuous operation in case of a failure.
SIMATIC: Siemens Automation Technology for Industry.
SIMATIC PCS 7: process control system that integrates various components of the SIMATIC family to provide a comprehensive solution for automating large-scale industrial processes.
Safety I/O: specialized modules designed to handle safety-critical signals
  - examples of such signals include Emergency Stop Buttons, Safety Sensors, Safety interlocks.
  - safety I/O modules are designed to meet stringent safety standards (like IEC 61508 or ISO 13849) and are often TÜV-certified.
Standard + Safety I/O: input/output (I/O) modules used in industrial automation systems that are capable of handling both standard (non-safety) signals and safety-critical signals.
Standard I/O: module used to interface with the standard control signals in an automation system like Sensor Inputs, Actuator Outputs
Terminal Bus: a network within the PCS7 architecture that connects operator stations, engineering stations, other human-machine interface (HMI) devices with each other and with the central control system, servers with databases.
  - typically operates using standard Ethernet-based network protocols like TCP/IP or Profinet or industrial ethernet.
